# SPRING 5 - dependency injection
- https://github.com/springframeworkguru
- Application context - where spring stores all bean
    - 3 types of DI
        - class properties (least preferred)
        - setter (not most preferred)
        - constructor (most preferred)
- Use DI with interface not classes
- Inversion of control (IoC) = technique to allow dependencies to be injected at runtime
    - ex: spring's container (it is how spring wire up all of the bean)
